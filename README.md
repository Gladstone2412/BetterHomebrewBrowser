# Better Homebrew Browser
A good homebrew browser. Massive thanks to [GrapheneCt](https://github.com/GrapheneCt) for his work on ScePaf.

## Features
1. It is the second ever app to use Sony's PlayStation Application Framework (PAF)
2. It is blazing fast
3. It is multithreaded so that you wonâ€™t get stopped by a single screenshot
4. It doesn't take 10 minutes to load *(cough)*
5. It has background downloading
6. It can download from both CBPS-DB and VitaDB
7. It looks, sounds, and feels almost exactly like the official PlayStation Store App
8. It can be opened alongside other apps
9. It has tunes (Yes, I've run out of things now)

## Downsides
1. Background downloads will be terminated without a warning when you open an enlarged memory mode game. There is no way to avoid this, but it's not a problem in most cases.

# Note
This *is* an open beta. So don't be surprised if it crashes. Bug reports are greatly appreciated.
