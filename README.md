# Better Homebrew Browser
The homebrew browser that's actually good. Massive thanks to GrapheneCt on his work on ScePaf

## Features
1. It is the second ever app to use Sony's PlayStation Application Framework (PAF).
2. It is multithreaded, so you won’t get stopped by a single screenshot
3. It doesn't take 10 minutes to load (cough)
4. It has background downloading
5. It can download from both CBPS-DB and VitaDB
6. It looks, sounds feels almost exactly like the official PlayStation Store App
7. It can be opened alongside other apps
8. It has tunes (Yes, I ran out of things now)

## Downsides
1. Background downloads will be terminated without warning when you open an enlarged memory mode game. There is no way to avoid this, but it's not a problem in most cases.
