# Better Homebrew Browser

A good homebrew browser. Massive thanks to [GrapheneCt](https://github.com/GrapheneCt) for his work on ScePaf.

## Features

1. It is the second ever app to use Sony's PlayStation Application Framework (PAF)
1. It is blazing fast
1. It is multithreaded so that you won’t get stopped by a single screenshot
1. It has background downloading
1. It can download from both CBPS-DB and VitaDB
1. It looks, sounds, and feels almost exactly like the official PlayStation Store App
1. It can be opened alongside other apps
1. It has tunes (Yes, I've run out of things now)

## Adding a new language

(Instructions by [GrapheneCt](https://github.com/GrapheneCt))

- Use [English locale](https://github.com/Ibrahim778/BetterHomebrewBrowser/blob/InDev/resource/locale/en.xml) as base. Name your translation XX.xml, where XX is language code.
Supported language codes can be seen [here](https://github.com/Ibrahim778/BetterHomebrewBrowser/blob/InDev/resource/bhbb_plugin.xml#L281) (id attribute).
- Submit your translation as pull request, it will be added in the next release.
