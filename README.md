## Adding a new language

  

(Instructions by [GrapheneCt](https://github.com/GrapheneCt))

  

- Use [English locale](https://github.com/Ibrahim778/BetterHomebrewBrowser/blob/InDev/resource/locale/en.xml) as base. Name your translation XX.xml, where XX is language code.

Supported language codes can be seen [here](https://github.com/Ibrahim778/BetterHomebrewBrowser/blob/InDev/resource/bhbb_plugin.xml#L281) (id attribute).
