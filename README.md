# Better Homebrew Browser
The homebrew browser that's actually good. Massive thanks to GrapheneCt on his work on ScePaf

## Features
1. It is the second ever app to use Sony's Play Station Application Framework.
1. It is multithreaded so you wont get stopped by a single screenshots
1. It doesn't take 10 minutes to load (*cough*)
1. It has background download
1. It can download from both CBPSDB and VitaDB
1. It looks, feels and sounds almost exactly like the official Play Station Store App
1. It can be opened alongside other apps
1. It has tunes (Yes I ran out of things now)

## Downsides
1. Background downloads will be terminated without warning when you open an enlarged memory mode game. No way to avoid this but it's not a problem in most cases.

## Credits
1. Thanks to GrapheneCt for ScePaf reversing and EMPVA (Refrence) and his CXML Compiler (Not Released)
